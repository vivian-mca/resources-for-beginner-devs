## Adding new resources

To add new resources to this project, please follow the steps below.

1. Find the category/categories you would like to add resources to. If you cannot find the category, please proceed to [Suggestions](#suggestions).
2. Check if the resources you would like to add already exists. If not, proceed to step 3.
3. The resources are formatted inside a table. The resource/s you would like to add should be added at the end of the table. It should include:
   - **Name and link** of the resource/s
   - **Type** of the resource/s, ex: video, article, etc.
   - **A brief description** of its contents and other related information

Example of how the **resource should be formatted**: <br>
`| [Name](https://example.com) | type | A brief description |`

Actual example: <br>
`| [GitHub Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#about-pull-requests) | Documentation | Full documentation about pull requests from GitHub Docs |`

**DON'T FORGET** the pipes (|) at the beginning and end of each row. Please make sure that the resource is formatted correctly and is consistent with the rest of the table.
